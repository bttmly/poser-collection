# Poser Collection

Creates an extensible Array-like class which has a lot of the Underscore collection methods.

`build.sh` creates a [browserified](http://browserify.org/) bundle with [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify). Install both packages globally to use the build script.

Based on [poser](https://github.com/bevacqua/poser/).
